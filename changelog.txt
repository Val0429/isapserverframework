v2.0 upgrade

Critical (Should modify code after upgrade):
1. "workspace" now should contain `package.json` & `node_modules`.

Normal (No need modify code):
1. Autoload web page from `/workspace/custom/web`.
2. You can now config `cgi-bin` root dir via `Config.core.cgiPath`.
3. You can now manage multiple project in workspace. just run `npm run create-project YourNewProjectName` in workspace.
4. You can now `npm start` in workspace.
5. Now cgi-bin Action won't check `permission` when `loginRequired` is false.
6. You can now hook Schedulers without write into Mongo. Try `Scheduler.register()`.
